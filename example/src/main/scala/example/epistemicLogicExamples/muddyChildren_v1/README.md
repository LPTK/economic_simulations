Here we simulate the muddy children example where an adult asks a group of children (at least one muddy) whether they know they have mud on their foreheads. If so, step forward. 

Children first look around and remember the status of other children, i.e. who has muddy forehead and who doesn't. Once they have remembered their neighbors' statuses, they will respond to what the adult says. 

When the parent speaks, they remember what the parent tells them and the number of times they heard. They respond right away, based on their current knowledgebase, without looking around checking for others' movements. 

After they answered the parent, they look around to see if any neighbor has stepped forward (became aware). As they observe each of the neighbor, they also think why s/he acted this way, and add the new knowledge.
