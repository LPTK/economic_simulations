This folder contains examples for the simulation. Upon completion (e.g. when "run SubclassExample" finishes), each example will create generated files in folder `economic_simulations/generated/main/scala/generated/`. 
Then you can start the simulation by running the Simulation object defined in `economic_simulations/generated/main/scala/Simulation.scala`
