This example simulates how rumor spreads over time in a population. In the initial setup, there is one person who seeds the rumor. The simulated population is 10000, each individual randomly connects with at most five others, and spreads rumors to his or her connections probabilistically. Please refer to the code for details such as the probability that a seed gossiper spreads rumor, etc.
