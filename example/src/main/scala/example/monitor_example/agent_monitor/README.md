This simple example pictures a game scenario where the chance of winning is pseudorandomly 50%. It demonstrates how to use another agent to collect and process data across time. The update happens in the following timestamp. Due to the presence of random number generator, so your output won't be exactly the same. But you should see something similar to the following   

Expected output: 
```
(TIMER,0)
Total wins: 0
Object1 wins the game!
(TIMER,1)
Total wins: 1
(TIMER,2)
Total wins: 1
(TIMER,3)
Total wins: 1
(TIMER,4)
Total wins: 1
Object1 wins the game!
(TIMER,5)
Total wins: 2
(TIMER,6)
Total wins: 2
(TIMER,7)
Total wins: 2
Object1 wins the game!
(TIMER,8)
Total wins: 3
(TIMER,9)
Total wins: 3
(TIMER,10)
Total wins: 3
Object1 wins the game!
...
```
