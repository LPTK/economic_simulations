### Write Classes using Code-Lifting
* Do not use val parameters, they can't be lifted.  Use var instead
* The optimzations created work for specific use-cases:
  * ActorMerge takes a pair of ActorType Names to specify which one to merge.  
  Take care, that the class variables are named differently in the two Sims
  * Stateless Server Optimization has following rules:
    * A stateless server here means a class whose methods don't change any of its attributes, because then those methods can be copied to other Sims.
    * A stateless server class should not have a wait in a non-blocking method, otherwise the program will not behave as the original
    * A stateless server cannot call a method from a non-stateless Server
    * An object can have only one reference to a (unique) specific stateless server class.
    It can have different references to different stateless servers(if those servers have unique attribute names among themselves).
    * The optimization has to be applied before using the EdgeMerge Optimization, since it requires the original graph
* Following structures are lifted by default: 
  * while(cond) {code}
  * var x = code
  * list.foreach(code)
  * (x <: Actor).\[methodCall\](...)
  * if(cond) code else code2
* You can use any other code, which does not contain a nested supported lifting structure.   
* You can extend the lifting by:
  * creating a subclass of algo
  * add in this subclass the nodes to the graph
  * Extend the lifter and override the method liftCodeOther  
  and handle there your created algos.
* You can call following additional functions:
  * asyncMessage(message) ... send a nonblocking message. Please checkout the example in folder nb_methods_example/ for how it is used 
  * waitTurns(x: Int) ... the Sim waits for x turns
  * waitTime(x: Double) ... the Sim waits for x unit of time. Time advances only when all Sims are waiting for time.
* It is required to use waitTurns at least once in a loop, like while(true),
  otherwise this Sim will not stop its step
* To lift a class annotate it with @lift and extend from runtime.Actor
 
### Run Classlifting-Examples
Make sure to run the code with enough stack size, otherwise you will get a StackOverflowError. 
You can set this parameter for example in Intellij by putting -Xss128m (128MB Stack size) at VM configuration in the 
configuration settings.

At the moment it is important to build squid locally (branch: class-lifting) before using this code. Since there is no public release for certain features.
```
// clone the squid repo: https://github.com/epfldata/squid.git
git checkout class-lifting
// inside the squid folder
bin/publishLocal.sh
// you should see "build 0.4.1-SNAPSHOT"
```
 
Please note that `/src/main/scala/ecosim` contains a standalone copy of the project in current master branch, which is the initial version that doesn't include message passing or relying on Squid. 

Examples in `meta`, upon successful termination, will generate files which are used for the actual simulation in 
folder `generated`. For example, consider the case `server_communication` in `src/main/scala/meta/example`. After running **ServerExample**, one should find 
files **BackendServer**, **FrontendServer**, and **InitData** been generated in folder `generated/main/scala/generated`. Now one 
can proceed to start the actual simulation by running **generated/main/scala/generated/Simulation** and the expected output is
```$xslt
(TIMER, 0)
...
(Time consumed, *some_number*)
```
If desired, you can test the actorMerge optimization by replacing the **ServerExample** with **ServerExampleMerge**. One should see the merged file `BackendServer_FrontendServer` being generated in 
`generated`. As of now, you need to modify the generated **InitData** file to start the merged actor. 

To test the performance with Spark support, you can run **generated/main/scala/generated/SimulationSpark** in lieu of **generated/main/scala/generated/Simulation** over IRs. Please do note
that the **InitData** is overwritten by the new example. It is easy to modify the output directory and package name for the desired simulation, where are specified in the ***Example** file. Upon 
such modification, please also change 

```actors = generated.InitData.initActors``` 

in **Simulation** to 

```actors = *new_package_name*.InitData.initActors```

where the **new_package_name** is what specified in ***Example** file with default value "generated" defined in `src/main/scala/meta/deep/codegen/CreateCode`. 
 
### Code Format
We use Scalafmt for formatting the code.
